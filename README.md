# How to build

1. Duplicate the appsettings files and remove the `.example` from their names.
2. Get your bot token and set it in one of the files (preferably NOT both of them).
    - `appsettings.json` is used when running in release mode
    - `appsettings.Development.json` is used when running in debug mode
3. Run the project.
